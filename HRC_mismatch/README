Comparing Backstop Command List and HRC HK values
-------------------------------------------------

This set of scripts extract command sequence from backstop log (planned commands),
and actual conditions from HRC HK data, and compare them to see whether there are
any discrepancies. If there are, one of the script sends out email warning to 
notify the discrepancies.

extract_backstop_comm.py
--------------------------
this script reads backstop command list and  extracts commands only related to HRC.
only the most recent file is read, and upate the data posted after starting data of
the file.

input: /data/mpcrit1/mplogs/*../ofls/*.backstop

output: <data_dir>/hrc_backstop_extracted2007

check_cmd_diff.py
-------------------
this script compares backstop commands and hrc hk record to find mismatched cases 

input:
	$start = $ARGV[0];	
	$stop  = $ARGV[1];
	if these are not given, the period is set between 2 days ago and today 23:00:00.
    <data_dir>/backstop_extract2007
    hrc hk0 fits files from archeive

output:
    <exc_dir>/cmd_diff_cont     #--- a file contains mismatched case information

Note: commands are recognized as "match" if the hrc hk has the same patern during the command
      issued time +/- 180 sec (+/- 3min). Even if there is no mached patern in that time
      period, if the next backstop command changes which is issued less than 30 sec from the original
      command has a match in hrc hk, then the original commands are ignored, and the latter
      command is recorded as "match" found.

comp_voltage.py
---------------
this script compares commanded HV setting and actual reading HV output 

input:
    hrc hk0 fits files from archeive (extracted by check_cmd_diff.py)

output:
    <exc_dir>/voltage_cont      #--- a file contains mismatched case information

check_dither_diff.py
----------------------
this script compares backstop dithercommands and hrc hk record to find mismatched 
cases

input:
	$start = $ARGV[0];	#---- format: 2007:210:00:00:00
	$stop  = $ARGV[1];
	if these are not given, the period is set between 2 days ago and today 23:00:00.
    <data_dir>/backstop_extract2007
    pcad pcad8eng data from archieve

output:
    <exc_dir>/dither_cont       #--- a file contains mismatched case information

Note: since enable command can be issued multiple times without any effect, this script
      check dither enable command only when dither disable command issued. 
      because of that, email warning is sent out only when dither disable has no match.

send_email_out.py
-----------------
this script sends out email if there are mismatch cases
input:
    <exc_dir>/cmd_diff_cont
    <exc_dir>/voltage_cont
    <exc_dir>/dither_cont
ouput:
    email sent out
    <record_dir>/email_<mm>_<dd>_<yyy>
